The source code for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/benfrankel/my-portfolio).

The site is deployed to [Netlify], where it is built from source using the static site generator [Hugo] and my own [Butter] theme[^1].

The `benfrankel.com` domain was registered through [Namesilo] \(for $8.99 / year).
