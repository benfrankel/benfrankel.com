Welcome to my website! If you like math, computers, puzzles, math puzzles, computer puzzles, computer math, building things, breaking things, or me, you've come to the right place. Well, there's not much here right now. But maybe some time in the future you'll have come to the right place retroactively.

Learn more [about me](about), see what I've [built](projects), or read what I've [written](blog).
