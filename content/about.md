Hello there! My name is **Ben Frankel**. I'm a student at **Iowa State University**, where I study **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**.

I love to learn new things, and I love to build new things. Lately I've been learning more about computer networks and the Internet.

I work on a [Thinkpad] E580 laptop powered by [Arch Linux] \(more on [my setup]). I do a lot of programming with [Python], but I also work in [C], [C++], [Java], and [Rust]. In the future I'd like to get to know some other languages, like [Go] \(neat concurrency), [Kotlin] \(interop with Java), and [Lua] \(interop with C).

If you have an interesting puzzle, [send](mailto:ben.frankel7@gmail.com) it to me!

Besides what I talk about here, I also like to play [Smash] \(I main Villager) and [Card Hunter].
