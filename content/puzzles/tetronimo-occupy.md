You have an 8x8 board, and you have to place a single kind of tetromino onto the board until no empty region of the board can fit a tetromino of that kind. No two placed tetrominoes may touch by their edges.

I consider tetrominoes that are reflections of each other to be different, so there are 7 possible choices:

For which tetrominoes is this possible, and how many pieces does it require (minimum)?
