You have an 8x8 board, and you must partially cover it with a single kind of tetromino in such a way that it is impossible to place any additional tetrominoes of that kind in the empty spaces. Additionally, no two tetrominoes may touch by their edges.

I consider tetrominoes that are reflections of each other to be different, so there are 7 possible choices:

</center>

For which tetrominoes is this possible, and how many pieces does it require (minimum)?
