**Susan was born** with an extreme case of the rare communication disorder, "dyscryptia", which has enthralled neuroscientists and computer scientists alike from all 6 corners of the globe. She is one of only a dozen recorded cases. This puzzling disorder is unique in that in each of the twelve cases, the disorder manifests itself in a distinct manner; the common denominator being that the disorder always affects communication letter by letter.

I met Susan just yesterday night at the local pizza parlor as she was playing a beautiful piece on the place's piano. I went up to her to compliment her playing, but of course, my message didn't get across. She pointed at a square board on top of the piano consisting of many common English words coupled with their translations, and I used it to repeat myself.

In the conversation that ensued, I found myself enchanted by this strange woman. I would like to prepare for the next time we meet, so that I may speak her language and offer a more comfortable conversation.

I remember a few useful details. Maybe my memories could serve as a Rosetta Stone, a bridge between our languages.

Susan referred to herself as "Nntog", and to her language as "Susubam". Following is a list of words and their translations that I can recall.

```
| Time | Good | Have | Give | Want | Take | Make | Know | Last | Long | Next | Come |
| Cvry | Vdsk | Iwam | Peal | Xohq | Ulpy | Nlpr | Yclh | Mtmf | Acus | Scrh | Rbrh |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| I | A | You | He | She | It | The | Of | On | And | But | Or | Right | Add | Near |
| I | A | Njt | Mm | Amx | Cc | Bmy | Uu | Cc | Ore | Wov | Gg | Apobl | Ehe | Sfsf |
```

There were more... but I can only remember so much.

Oh, and as I was leaving, she told me, "Hgjqz cqjos njmh yizaj, cm'i hgqccnkb rapf am clp". She must have forgotten for a moment that I don't speak Susubam?
