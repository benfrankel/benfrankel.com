### Encryption

To translate English into Susubam,

1. Interpret the letters as numbers (a=1, ..., z=26).
2. Add pairs of consecutive numbers (wrapping to the left).
3. Subtract 26 from the numbers that are greater than 26.
4. Interpret the numbers as letters.

For example,

1. `t-i-m-e `
2. `20-09-13-05 `
3. `29-21-18-25`
4. `03-21-18-25`
5. `c-v-r-y `

It's difficult to translate Susubam back into English, because information is lost in the translation.

When I was leaving, Susan said "Sorry about your pizza, it's probably cold by now".
