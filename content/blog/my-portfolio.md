The source code for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/benfrankel/my-portfolio), and the static site itself can be found [here](https://github.com/benfrankel/benfrankel.github.io).

I build the site from source using the static site generator [Hugo] with the [Cocoa Enhanced] theme, and then I deploy to [Github Pages].

The `benfrankel.me` domain name was registered through [Namecheap] \(free of charge, as long as I have a .edu email).

I use [Cloudflare] for HTTPS support, because Github Pages' content delivery network does not (at the time of this writing) support HTTPS for custom domain names. See [here](https://gist.github.com/coolaj86/e07d42f5961c68fc1fc8) for the latest news on that front.

The logo was drawn with [Inkscape].

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="/img/logo.svg" alt="Logo" style="width: 200px;" />
