Sometimes my friends introduce me as their "smart friend". I get why they do that. The way they see it, being smart is a good thing -- something to be proud of. They're proud of me, and they want to brag about me.

But it makes me uncomfortable.

- It reduces me to a single attribute; one that I had no choice in, and that I don't see as something to be proud of.
- It sets expectations for how I'm supposed to behave.
- It implies a comparison and encourages a toxic superiority / inferiority dynamic.
- It paints me as different and unrelatable, which makes it hard to form a connection as an equal.
- It evokes preconceived notions of what a "smart person" looks like: Socially awkward, narcissistic, argumentative, better-than-everyone-else, etc.

I feel like I have to fight an uphill battle to prove that I'm a good person. I would never introduce myself as the "smart friend", but when someone else does it for me, it's out of my control. I have to fight the stigma and downplay my intelligence to make the other person feel comfortable.

A better introduction would be something like, "this is my friend from \_\_\_\_, he works in \_\_\_\_, we like to do \_\_\_\_". No attributes attached, so my character can speak for itself.
