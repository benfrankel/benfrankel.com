My bike was stolen today while I was getting groceries. I don't have a car, so I'm going to have to replace the bike or get a car or something. In the meantime I'll walk to the grocery store. It's kind of sad, because I'd finally fixed the flat rear tire just a few days ago. They took the rear tire, but they left the front tire and the lock. I had the bike for 1 year.

RIP.
