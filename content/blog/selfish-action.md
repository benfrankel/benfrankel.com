There is an inconsistency in the way I think about selfishness. Through this inconsistency, I have discovered a reflection, in myself, of a fundamental assumption that our society has conditioned itself to accept. I want to challenge that assumption and my own unawaredly blind acceptance of it.

## The Inconsistency

In an attempt to construct an argument against exploratory hacking[^1], I ended up relying on the fact that unwanted hackers necessarily harm their targets (e.g., by forcing them to investigate whether files were altered or sensitive information was stolen), but they do it only to benefit themselves. I argued that harming someone else, motivated solely by personal gain, must be unethical.

But then I thought of something else.

> What if I opened a lemonade stand across from another lemonade stand, and stole its customers?

Am I not harming someone, motivated solely by personal gain?

But that's fair, that's how competition works. If I didn't do it, somebody else would have: it was the will of the invisible hand of the free market.

However, suppose I did something else instead.

> What if I stole a cup of lemonade from a lemonade stand?

Now, there's an activity we can probably agree is unethical.

But why is it unethical? I'm harming the lemonade stand owner to benefit myself --- surely that must be the problem. That can't be it, though, because in this scenario I'm taking one cup of lemonade for myself, while in the first scenario I'm taking several paying customers for myself, which is likely a more severe harm.

## The Assumption

The critical distinction between the two scenarios derives from our implicit collective assumption that **competition over resources is necessary**. In fact, in our capitalist society, not only do we tolerate the behavior, but we encourage and even celebrate it. Triumph over others and the accumulation of wealth have become the meaning of life.

The assumption is a form of self-fulfilling prophecy: We expect everyone around us to compete for resources, so we rightfully conclude that, in order to survive, we must do the same. We internalize it as an inseparable part of human nature, and it forms the basis of our moral judgements.

If one person changes their behavior, they'll just get exploited by everyone else, so society is in a kind of equilibrium. Therefore, my aim is not to convince you, or anyone else, that we need to try to change the structure of society.

I believe we should be aware of all our moral assumptions, and we should allow no moral assumption to persist under the radar, unchallenged, and unjustified.

Maybe competition is unethical in the absence of scarcity; maybe unnecessary selfish action is morally justified; or maybe competition is a necessary part of human behavior. However you choose to reconcile the apparent conflict of moral judgement, as long as you can consciously justify your distinction, that is a step in the right direction.
